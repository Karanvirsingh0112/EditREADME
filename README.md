2.1Explore challenges associated with multimodality like accuracy requirement in image registration 
and data processing.

Below are the technique to work on accuracy in data optimization and image registration:
 Image Registration Accuracy:
•	Calibration:  we can start by calibrating our camera and sensors to ensure that they aligned correctly. Visual Inspection can be done by overlaying images from different modalities and visual inspection for any misalignment. Adjust your calibration parameters accordingly. This involves using calibration patterns and software to map the different images to a common coordinate system.
•	Multi-Spectral Alignment: Since we’re working with multiple modalities (visual, UV, IR), we’ll need to perform image registration to align the images captured by different sensors. This can be done using feature-based or intensity-based methods. You could explore algorithms like SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) or SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) to detect keypoints across different modalities and align them.

 Data Processing Challenges
              Synchronization:
•	Time Stamping: For the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, we could use the built-in Real-Time Clock (RTC) or external timing mechanisms to ensure that all data streams are synchronized. Through this we can better optimize the data and would be easy to store at servers for any further company inspection and processing.
Data Fusion Techniques:
•	Pixel-Level Fusion: Combine the data at the pixel level, where corresponding pixels from different modalities are merged. This can be done using techniques like weighted averaging or selecting the most informative pixel based on a criterion (e.g., highest contrast). Then these can be stitched together to get more informative inspectable pictures. 
Computational Efficiency:
•	Algorithm Optimization: Since the Arduino Nano 33 BLE has limited computational power, optimizing our algorithms is crucial. Use efficient data structures, minimize floating-point operations, and offload complex processing tasks to external hardware if possible.
•	Edge Computing: we will do  preprocessing the data on the Arduino before sending it to a more powerful computer for intensive processing. This could involve simple filtering, downsampling, or thresholding to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.
•	Real-Time Constraints: Implement real-time processing pipelines where the most computationally intensive tasks are only performed when necessary. For example, you might prioritize certain processing steps based on the detected level of microplastics.
